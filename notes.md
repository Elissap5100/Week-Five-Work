# Week Five Notes

## Reading Notes

### https://electricarchaeology.ca/2019/12/20/making-nerdstep-music-as-archaeological-enchantment-or-how-do-you-connect-with-people-who-lived-3000-years-ago/

- Just a quick note: I read through the process of how you developped your "musical data song"... super cool. I had never heard of this before and although some of it went over my head it was very interesting to learn about how it came to be. The thinking behind the entire concept is really refreshing. The program I am studying at carelton is all about digital storytelling and sharing narratives using different mediums of technology. This way using sound is completely new to me!

- **http://songsoftheottawa.ca/** : I skimmed through this as well. I see it is the same idea. This is super interesting. I would love to learn more/ see this done with different tpes/sets of data!

### Best DH Data Visualization’ from 2019 DH Awards

- **https://www.behance.net/gallery/83315693/Italo-Calvino-text-data-data-visualization-book** : This by far was my favourite of all the entries. I studied data visualization early this year (and a bit throughout this course) and I really like how this project made use of the different types charts available. In this case, I like just how many different types of data he is displaying, from originally one text. He is analyxing what feel like douzens of different paterns, using various different visualizations. I really would like to attempt a project like this one day. Not to mention, that the display of his book is overall very aesthetically pleaseing(from the font down to the colour scheme as well)!
- **https://ventesdantiques.inha.fr/story.php#fr/86093/ventes** : I found this project very impressive as well. Specifically, the smoothness of the animation using the map and how it effectively told the narrative it was trying to share in a visual and easy to digest way. The colour coordination with the major points in history with the map and descriptions was very impressive as well. I would be very interested to see the "behind the scenes" work of this project.

### Best DH Public Engagement’ from 2019 DH Awards

- **https://glam-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/dd/documents/Open_a_GLAM_Lab-10-screen.9c4c9c7.pdf** : This project was an overall interesting read. I skimmed through it as it was very vast, but I can understand why it did so well. It is through, well thoughtout and elaborate. They have a mission and they have prepared to spread their mission. From a design standpoint, the document was quite nicely put together. It is vibrant and inviting, but does not take away from its content.

## Task Notes

### Podcasting - Green Eggs and Ham 

- I would like to start off by saying that I was not sure what to record for the audacity tutorial you linked in this section so I just read a snip-it of "Green Eggs and Ham" by Doctor Seuss (https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/2131-02/A2/trythemsource.txt). For some reason a person from Ottawa U posted the entire text online in a basic text file... so thank you for that.
- The completed file is in my repository
- I am not sure if you will listen to this tutorial... just know it was a completely uneccessary reading of Green Eggs and Ham with some classical music and basic audio editing skills thrown in there. All that's to say that I do feel comfortable for the next part of this week's task. 

### Podcasting - 5 Min DH Rant

- I completed my mini Podcast rant. it was abit weird to record my own voice, but I actually enjoyed it. I wish I was better and editing audio/putting my ideas all together... but I had fun doing it and I earned abit more about the software. I used a few extra "effects" than the orginal tutorial and I am proud of that!
- As a challenge next time, I might try to add little sound effects at specific parts.. it might be fun!
- This link to the "background music" I used in this 'Podcast': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LFY5FZ0Zgs (royalty free)
- I will admit, I find editing sound in the adobe programs much easier (when I do videos for school/work), but that is also majory because I am used to their platform

### Sonification

- I tried to look for my own set of data to play around with, so I would understand how the music more closely related to the data it was representing but I could not find anything. That is mainly because I was unsure where to look and what exactly to look for. Although,This gave me a chance to play around with the auditory options in TwoTone quite abit and learn alot abut how the changes could be used to better represent data.
- To be fair, I know absolutely nothing about music.All of my observations are based purely on what I feel as an untrained ear and historian.
- I mentioned this at the beginning of this note, but the representation of data via music is super impactful to me. Playing around with the different notes, instruments and tempos, I leanred that these variables can truely be manipulated and layered on top of one another to create a sort of aura or 'vibe' that sounds are famous for. 
- If the data you are representing is darker or somber, you can set the mood with lower notes and a slower tempo to represent the dark context of the data. Or if it is something more 'alive' or lighter, you can use higher notes, lighter instruments and a mix of medium to fast tempos for the layered music. 
- The program seemingly does this on its own, but when there is a spike in the data, it obviouly coneys this in its sound. This creates meaningful chages in the song to represent the data. It goes from mild/smaller sounds for smaller/common numbers to loud and intense spikes in the audio to represent those data points that stick out. This is also helpful to show major changes in the data.
- Overall, I am finding that audio is a very refreshing, effective and meaningful way to represent data. It tells a story in a way most people are familiar with in one way or another - that being music and sound - but in a different context. I really like this and would love to see more examples of this with both history and other content.
- As always, my creation is in the repository.

### Telling Stories with StoryMaps

I was not sure what to cover, so I simply mapped out the 7 Wonders of the World. All the information (pictures, text, location, etc) was taken from this website: https://www.travelchannel.com/interests/outdoors-and-adventure/articles/new-seven-wonders-of-the-world

Here is the link: https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/06af2dd60026226f1e0a9ea7326aac8d/digital-history-3814/index.html

### Webmapping with Leaflet

- **Jamaican Slave Revolt** : I took a few minutes to look through this map and I am so impressed. It is so well done and informative, but also very pleasing to the eye,

- Everything worked fine! I had some trouble starting up th server, but to fix that I simply had to follow the steps in the Anaconda Command Prompt rather than my basic commandline.
- I will attempt to upload it to my repository for this week!

### Georectifying a base map

- This worked fine! I had trouble finding a new map on the archive website, so I used the one you provided.

### Adding a layer control button

- No issues here!

### Adding animation

- This one took me abit of ime to work but I think I got it!

### Sprucing up a PDF in Inkscape

- Although I have expirience in poster design and graphic design, I had never used inkscape or edited a Pdf like this before. (having the components turn into individual elements was a good skill to learn!

### Make an Academic Poster

- WILL DO SOON
