'things that have driven me nuts about learning digital historyâ€™.

1.  The amount of things that must be downloaded
- I just cleaned this computer before this course started and now its filed with random programs
- I forget what I download last week everytime I start a new week
- I never figured out where to put the .exe files when downloading new programs

2. My failing memory
- We learn so many cool things, espcially coding, and I am so grateful for the throurougly written instructions because I forget things literally minutes after they happen
- Last week we had to do something we did in the second week again, It took me a good 5 minutes to remeber all that

3. the 'history' part of digital history
- Never has been my thing
- I like pretty pictures
- Love the process sing technoloy, not always content

4. When things unexplicably dont work
-Even google fails me
- i try so hard cause I want it to work but it wont and there is nothing I can do?
